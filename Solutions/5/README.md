X.509 Certificate Creation Sample
=================================

This web page with associated JavaScript allows a user to
create a self-signed X.509 certificate.

This example is provided to illustrate how to use the W3C
[Web Cryptography API](http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/ "API Draft")
and [PKIjs](https://pkijs.org/ "PKIjs Home Page") libraries.

Using this example requires a web browser that implements a compatible version
of the Web Cryptography API.
When the example was created, current versions of Google Chrome,
Firefox, and Opera browsers could run the example.

**This is not intended to be a production tool.** Rather, it may
be helpful to developers who intend to create their own tools using
the Web Cryptography API.
